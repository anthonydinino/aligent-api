# Date and Time API




## Key Points
I'm choosing node.js for my runtime due to reduced boiler plate code, ease-of-use and popularity.

I'm choosing express also due to it's minimalistic yet robust set of features and popularity with nodejs.

I need to allow for multiple timezones. I'm going to allow the user to select any GMT timezone that is compatible with an ISO string. E.G GMT+09:30
