# Date and Time API

## Nodejs

I'm choosing node.js for my runtime due to reduced boiler plate code, ease-of-use and popularity.

## Express

I'm choosing express also due to it's minimalistic yet robust set of features and popularity with nodejs.

Using express.Router() I can use multiple files for routing making the api more manageable

## Thoughts

I'm using datetime-local input type because that gives me the most amount of data from the user without having to modify seperate data.

I need to allow for multiple timezones. I'm going to allow the user to choose their timezone locale of choice.
